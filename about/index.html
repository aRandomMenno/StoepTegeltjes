                        17-year-old dutch boy, still studying at het Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. Languages: Dutch and
                        English. Not sure which direction to go with within the software developer course. I like
                        sleeping, it's also good for you :D. I want to become an ethical hacker. I'm a cat person
                        however dogs are also nice animals. I have a sister. <br>
                        <i>Scroll down to see two cat pictures</i>
                    </p>

                    <h1 id="lm"><span id="dd">Hello</span> dear reader, ðŸ‘‹</h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is <name>Menno Van Zoelen</name>, a 17-year-old Dutch boy living in Spijkenisse.
                        Currently, I am studying at het Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, where I am following
                        the course Creative Software Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the moment for school, I am working mainly with <span style="color: orange;">HTML</span>,
                        <span style="color: aqua;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color: yellow;">JavaScript</span>.
                        However, in the future, that might change depending on what I choose to do within the course. I
                        could choose to study <span style="color: deeppink;">UI/UX</span>, which is mostly designing and
                        creating the interfaces people use, or I could choose <span style="color: deeppink;">IoT</span>
                        which stands for "Internet of Things", which has everything to do with micro-computers,
                        printers, routers, and much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However I am not sure yet which direction to choose, there is also a direction where you will
                        learn more about harder programming languages like C, C++, Java or any other fo your choosing.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Do you have any hobbies?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, I have two hobbies: programming and sleeping. programming is self explained I am following
                        a Software Developer course. But sleeping is just, sleeping it helps you take your mind of
                        things and you need sleep to stay alive so... yeah get some good sleep every night ðŸ’¤.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Some personal things:</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am an introverted person with autism, which means I am not very good at socializing with
                        people nor do I like attention, except when you're already my friend or family. But regardless
                        of that, I always try to be nice even if you are not very nice to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One "goal" I have is to become an ethical hacker, which is a person who hacks
                        for good and not for bad. They help companies to find vulnerabilities in their systems and then
                        report those vulnerabilities to the company so they can fix them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I actually do not really like to go to school; I think it is a necessary evil. While yes, I like
                        to learn new things, I think that the way the school system is set up is not the best way to
                        learn things.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Anything else?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes I really like cats. I had one cat when my dad moved to Belgium; he got
                        lost. I do miss him a bit; his name was Thor. Here's two pictures of him:
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>I have a sister.</h2>
                    <p>
                        She is 19 years old (at the time of writing) and is also studying at het Grafisch Lyceum
                        Rotterdam. And she is also following the course Creative Software Developer. She has her own
                        website too, you can find it at
