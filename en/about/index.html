            <p class="text">
                I am Menno, a 16 year old boy who lives in the Netherlands near Rotterdam and I have a passion for 
                programming and hacking, although I must admit I'm still learning and improving. I often find
                myself gaming more than coding, which is something I'm working on changing. I truly enjoy
                activities that contribute to my personal growth and can potentially make a difference.
            </p>

                When I first started programming it was with html, which you may not consider to be a programming
                language and fair it might not be but it introduced me to the concept of programming as a whole. And
                now, I know a little bit of HTML, CSS, JS and Python,
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                compared to other people I know very little about
                programming but I dislike comparing myself to others. I also still live by my rule "my code does not
                work, I don't know why. I change some things, it now works, I don't know why."
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Currently I'm a student, im follow a Software Developer course at the
                <a href="https://glr.nl/">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a> it will take 3 years to complete this course
                and I've started in august of 2024, so I expect to be done in 2027. and move on to a HBO Cyber Security course.

                I also have a sister at the moment of writing this she's 19 years old, she is transgender and
                has her <a href="https://astralVRZ.github.io/" target="_blank">own website</a>, she is really a great sister.
                She is also following the same software developer course as I am, we are not in the same class though, I don't
                know if that's good or bad.
