            <h2 class="center"> Some facts about me! </h2>
            <p class="text">
                I am Menno, a 16-year-old boy living in the Netherlands, near Rotterdam. I have a passion for
                programming and ethical hacking, although I must admit that I still need to improve, but I'm always
                learning new things. However, I often spend more time gaming than coding or learning to hack, and I'd
                like to change that. I also enjoy things that help me grow as a person and make the world a better
                place.
            </p>

                When I first started programming, it was in HTML. Some people don't consider that a programming
                language, and that might be true, but HTML introduced me to the concept of programming. Nowadays, I know
                a fair amount about HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.

                Compared to other programmers, I might not know much, but
                I don't like comparing myself to others. Often, when I'm coding, I live by the rule: "My code doesn't
                work, I don't know why. I change something, now it works, but I still don't know why." I am trying more
                and more to understand the code I write myself or the code I copy.

                Currently, I am a student and I am pursuing the (Creative) Software Developer program at the <a
                    href="https://glr.nl/">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a>. This program lasts three years. I started in
                August 2024, so I will finish in 2027, provided I do not fall behind. After that, I would like to pursue
                a Cyber Security program at a higher professional education (HBO) level.

                I am a cat person. Many cats are very friendly and cute. I have also had cats myself. Below, you can see
                two pictures of one of those cats. <br>

                I have a sister, and at the time I'm writing this, she is 19 years old (young). She is transgender, and
                I have no problem with that. If you do, I care <i>very</i> little about it. She also has her own
                website; <a href="https://astralVRZ.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> you can check it out. She is
                studying the same program as I am, (Creative) Software Developer, but we are not in the same class.
