                    I am Menno, a 16-year-old boy living in the Netherlands,
                    near Rotterdam. I have a passion for
                    programming and ethical hacking, although I must admit that
                    I still need to improve, but I'm always
                    learning new things. However, I often spend more time gaming
                    than coding or learning to hack, and I'd
                    like to change that. I also enjoy things that help me grow
                    as a person and make the world a better
                    place.
                </p>

                    When I first started programming, it was in HTML. Some
                    people don't consider that a programming
                    language, and that might be true, but HTML introduced me to
                    the concept of programming. Nowadays, I know
                    a fair amount about HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to other programmers, I might not know much, but
                    I don't like comparing myself to others. Often, when I'm
                    coding, I live by the rule: "My code doesn't
                    work, I don't know why. I change something, now it works,
                    but I still don't know why." I am trying more
                    and more to understand the code I write myself or the code I
                    copy.

                    Currently, I am a student and I am pursuing the (Creative)
                    Software Developer program at the <a href="https://glr.nl/">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a>.
                    This program lasts three years. I started in
                    August 2024, so I will finish in 2027, provided I do not
                    fall behind. After that, I would like to pursue
                    a Cyber Security program at a higher professional education
                    (HBO) level.

                    I am a cat person. Many cats are very friendly and cute. I
                    have also had cats myself. Below, you can see
                    two pictures of one of those cats. <br>

                    I have a sister, and at the time I'm writing this, she is 19
                    years old (young). She is transgender, and
                    I have no problem with that. If you do, I care <i>very</i>
                    little about it. She also has her own
                    website; <a href="https://astralVRZ.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> you can check it out. She is
                    studying the same program as I am, (Creative) Software
                    Developer, but we are not in the same class.
