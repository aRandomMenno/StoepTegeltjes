            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    I am Menno, a 16-year-old boy living in the Netherlands, near Rotterdam. I have a passion for programming and hacking, although I must admit that I am still learning and improving. I often find myself gaming more than coding, something I am working to change.

            <h3>What motivates me for this course?</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    I chose the Creative Software Developer course at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam because I have a strong interest in technology and creativity. The parts of the study that appeal to me the most are programming, ethical hacking, and developing innovative solutions. I am curious about how I can improve my skills and how I can make a positive impact with my work. My goal is to continue in Cyber Security after this course and to keep developing myself in this field.
