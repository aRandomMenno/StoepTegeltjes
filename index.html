            Hi, I am Menno<s1 id='marshMenno'>MarshMenno</s1>, <br>
            I am a boy born in the Netherlands, and I live in
            <a onclick='redirect("Spijkenisse")'></a>Spijkenisse. <br>
            <br>
            I enjoy Programming, I think it's quite relaxing. I mainly program in
            Python, or JavaScript. I also like tech, like computers I have a
            raspberry Pi 5 but I haven't used it for anything but I do have idea's
            what to use it for I just need to find the motivation to start working
            on those idea's. <br>
            <br>
            When programming I mostly live by one simple motto: 'My code doesn't
            work, I don't know why. I change some things, it now works, I don't know
            why.' <br>
            The previous rewrite of the site was actually quite plain and simple
            with a theme switcher, however I probably wont bring back the theme
            switcher. sorry :(<br>
            <br />
            I am also one person on this planet that dislikes governments very,
            <i>very</i> much, I'm actually an anarchist. Even though I don't show
            it. I also like to have online privacy, which Google, Microsoft,
            Tencent, Apple etc. don't give me, which makes me very upset. <br>
            <br>
            One thing that also makes me mildly angry is that it's currently better
            for the user experience (IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING) to pirate
            movies & video games etc, but I only pirate movies, sometimes games but
            that is because I then don't support what the developer of that game is
            doing. <br>

        In the future when I am working etc, I would like to emigrate to
        <a onclick='redirect("Finland")'>Finland</a>, the reason for this is because I think it is a
        very interesting country, and in the winter there is a lot of snow! and in
        the Netherlands we almost never get snow these days.
