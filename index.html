        <p>
          My name is Menno and I am a 16-year-old student. 
          In my free time, outside of school, I have some experience with programming. 
          I have my own website, aRandomMenno.github.io, which Is this site and I have written it almost completely by myself. 
          The rest of the code I got from the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my greatest passions is programming, which has become more than just a hobby; it's a way of life. 
          I enjoy working with various programming languages, with Python, HTML, and CSS being my primary choices. 
          They allow me to bring my creative ideas to life on the web. 
          I also once tried my hand at C++ programming, but I must admit, it was quite a challenge!
        </p>

          As a cat lover, I can't resist the charm of these feline companions. 
          Their independence and playfulness make them the perfect pets, and they often inspire me in many ways.
          Nevertheless, I'm always eager to learn and explore new horizons in the ever-evolving world of technology.
          These are some things about who I am and what I do, Since I don't want to share my entire life.

          <h3>aRandomMenno.github.io, aka this one.</h3>
          I started this website as a hobby project to learn basic html and css but I think it has gotten a bit out my hands.
          I've redesigned this website a lot. More than I want to admit... and this? Will hopefully be the last revision of my site.
