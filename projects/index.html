        <h2>aRandomMenno.github.io</h2>
        <p>
            I initially made this website as a hobby project to learn html and css, but it grew and I am now also
            learning JavaScript, <br>
            I rewrote this website many times and I think every time I did that the website got 'better'. <br>
            I hope this is the last time I decided to rewrite my entire website.

        <h2>MarshMellow Bot</h2>
        <p>
            This will be the main discord bot for my <a onclick='redirect("discord")'>discord</a> server, <br> If I ever
            feel like continuing working on the bot... :)

        <h2 style="color: #ff0000;">TappsBox (archived)</h2>
        <p>
            This is a small Python program that uses opencv-Python to find an image on screen move the mouse to it with
            PyAutoGUI and click on it. <br>
            I rewrote this a couple of times because I found some new optimization technics. <br>
            This project was archived by me because I don't feel like working om it anymore. if you want to optimize it
            further you may fork it. <br>

        <h2> <a onclick="redirect('RiMusic')">RiMusic</a> by Fast4x</h2>
        <p>
            This is a music player, which is just an application which can play any video/music from YouTube (Music)
            <br>
            It is a fork of <a onclick="redirect('ViMusic')">ViMusic</a> which is probably abandoned by it's
            creator/maintainer. <br>
            This is my primary music app, the app also caches any music played so you can play your favorite songs
            offline for free! <br>
            (In settings you can change the size of the cached songs so the app can't fill your entire phones storage
            with music) <br>
            I switched to ViMusic first (from Spotify), but after I found RiMusic I immediately switched to it. <br>
