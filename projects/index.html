      <h2>aRandomMenno.github.io (this website)</h2>
      <p>
        I initially made this website as a hobby project to learn html and css, but it grew and I am now also learning
        JavaScript, <br>
        I rewrote this website many times and I think every time I did that the website got 'better'. <br>
        I hope this is the last time I decided to rewrite my entire website.

      <h2>MarshMellow Bot (discord Bot)</h2>
      <p>
        This will be the main discord bot for my <a onclick="redirect('discord')">discord</a> server, <br>
        If I ever feel like continuing working on the bot... :)

      <h2>TappsBox (archived)</h2>
      This is a small Python program that uses opencv-Python to find an image on screen move the mouse to it with PyAutoGUI
      and click on it. <br>
      I rewrote this a couple of times because I found some new optimization technics. <br>
      This project was archived by me because I don't feel like working om it anymore. if you want to optimize it further
      you mat fork it.

      <h2> <a onclick="redirect('RiMusic')">RiMusic</a> by Fast4x</h2>
      <p>
        This is a music player, which is just an application which can play any video/music from YouTube (Music) <br>
        It is a fork of <a onclick="redirect('ViMusic')">ViMusic</a> which is probably abandoned by it's creator/maintainer.
        <br>
        This is my primary music app, the app also caches any music played so you can play your favorite songs offline for
        free! <br>
        (In settings you can change the size of the cached songs so your device doesn't get filled up with only music.) <br>
        I switched to ViMusic first (from Spotify), but after I found RiMusic I immediately switched to it. <br>
