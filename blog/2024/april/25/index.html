        <h2>April 11</h2>
        <p>
            I am bored out of my mind, <br>
            Also YouTube is cracking down on adBlocking even more, they have made some changes to their API that third
            party applications use to play video's from their application. <br>
            They changed the rules around their API, now it is not allowed to block the ads. so Google can spoonfeed you
            more ads. <br>
            I would be like yea it's fine if they don't absolutely spam you with ads, which they do btw, come on 2
            unskippable 30 seconds ad every other video you watch? WTF!? <br>
            Secondly, most of the ads playing are scams, for example one time I got an ad saying that I won $1000 if I
            clicked the link in it's 'description'. <br>
            However that website, was a scam, basically you had to do some tasks and then you would get your prize of
            $1000 but you would never get that because the tasks were followed by you needing to do more tasks exposing
            you to more scam websites in turn giving your information to more people with malicious intents. <br>
